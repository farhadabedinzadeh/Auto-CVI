# Auto-CVI-Tool
Automatic toolbox for Cluster Validity Index(CVI)

A cluster analysis involves identifying the optimal number and natural division of clusters through automatic clustering. A cluster validity index (CVI) can be used to estimate the number of clusters with relative ease. Several cluster solutions have been proposed in the literature in terms of intra-cluster cohesiveness and inter-cluster separation. In spite of this, it is crucial to identify the situations where these CVIs work well and their limitations.
To estimate the number of clusters, this toolbox presents 22 robust CVIs. It is extremely user-friendly and does not require any coding knowledge.
Without writing a single line of code, it is possible to compare 22 CVIs and visualize the results in a comparable manner.
As soon as the data is loaded, all parameters are automatically provided, and the CVIs can be compared without any additional programming.
It is important to note that one section of this [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3449639.3459341) was used in the development of this toolbox, and if you use any part of it, please reference both the reference paper and me.
